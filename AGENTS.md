# Qualitative Coding Analysis System

This file is a generated Codex-oriented projection of repo governance.
Edit the canonical sources instead of editing this file directly.

Canonical governance sources:
- `CLAUDE.md` — human-readable project rules, workflow, and references
- `scripts/relationships.yaml` — machine-readable ADR, coupling, and required-reading graph

## Purpose

*Last Updated: 2026-06-21*

> **Canonical status/theory docs (read before describing the system).** This
> file is the **operational** reference (architecture, commands, config). The
> *strategic* layer — honest state ledger, the INV-0..11 architectural
> invariants, the **claim-discipline** table (what you may/may not assert), the
> roadmap, and the prior-art/competitive landscape — lives in
> **`docs/PROJECT_THEORY_AND_GOALS.md`**, and the SOTA-evaluation plan in
> **`docs/EVALUATION_HARNESS.md`**. Where this file and the theory doc disagree
> about *status or claims*, the theory doc wins. Do not assert "validated",
> "full grounded theory", "SOTA", or "inter-rater reliability" without the
> caveats in theory doc §14.

## Commands

```bash
make test               # Run deterministic test suite (excludes live LLM E2E)
make test-quick         # Run tests, minimal output
make test-e2e           # Run live LLM E2E tests
make test-all           # Run deterministic tests and live LLM E2E tests
make lint               # Run Ruff fatal-error lint gate
make docs-check         # Run documentation and governance checks
make check              # Run deterministic tests + lint + docs checks
make status             # Show git status
make bench ID=<project_id>              # Phase 0 scorecard (D1/D2/D5/D10 plus optional D7/INV-7 scores)
python qc_cli.py bench <project_id>     # Same Phase 0 scorecard through the canonical CLI
make bench ID=<project_id> GOLD=gold.json BASELINES=baselines.json  # Add external D7 gold/baselines without mutating project state
make bench ID=<project_id> PROMPT_INJECTION=inv7.json  # Add external INV-7 fixture results without mutating state
make bench ID=<project_id> OBS_DB=path TRACE_ID=trace  # Override D10 observability DB / exact trace
make bench ID=<project_id> ARTIFACT_DIR=benchmark_results  # Write versioned Phase 0 scorecard package
make cost               # Show LLM spend (DAYS=7)
make errors             # Show recent error breakdown

# Pipeline (local run; `project run` needs no server, `analyze` needs the API server)
python qc_cli.py project run <project_id>
python qc_cli.py project run <project_id> --exhaustive   # code every segment (INV-8)
python qc_cli.py project scope <project_id> --phenomenon "..."  # show/update corpus scope
python qc_cli.py project claims <project_id>              # inspect first-class claim ledger (INV-9)
```

## Operating Rules

This projection keeps the highest-signal rules in always-on Codex context.
For full project structure, detailed terminology, and any rule omitted here,
read `CLAUDE.md` directly.

### Principles

- LLM-first: all semantic analysis uses structured LLM output via Pydantic schemas + JSON mode
- Fail loud: inter-stage dependency checks raise on failure; never silently degrade
- Single state model: `ProjectState` Pydantic model holds all state, saved/loaded as JSON
- Observability: all LLM calls log model/schema/prompt/cost/token usage via llm_client

### Workflow

1. Feed transcript files (txt/docx/pdf/rtf) to the pipeline
2. Default 7-stage pipeline: Ingest → Thematic Coding → Perspective Analysis → Relationship Mapping → Synthesis → Cross-Interview → Negative Case (disconfirmation runs last; INV-6)
3. Human review via CLI or browser; IRR via `project irr`
4. Inspect claim ledger via `project claims` or `/projects/{project_id}/claims`
5. Export to JSON/CSV/Markdown/QDPX

## Machine-Readable Governance

`scripts/relationships.yaml` is the source of truth for machine-readable governance in this repo: ADR coupling, required-reading edges, and doc-code linkage. This generated file does not inline that graph; it records the canonical path and sync marker, then points operators and validators back to the source graph. Prefer deterministic validators over prompt-only memory when those scripts are available.

The end product is public and SOTA-targeting; the UNMET invariants are a committed build spec, not a wishlist.

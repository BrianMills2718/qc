**Analysis Period:** 440.0 seconds  
**Research Methodology:** LLM-Native Qualitative Coding with Grounded Theory  

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive qualitative analysis of **18 interviews** examining how AI methods are being integrated into qualitative research practices at RAND Corporation. Using an innovative LLM-native approach that processes all interviews simultaneously (leveraging the 1M+ token context window), we identified **5 major themes**, **62 hierarchical codes**, and **10 exemplar quotes** with full traceability.

### Key Findings

**Research Question:** How are AI methods being integrated into qualitative research practices?

**Emergent Theory:** The integration of AI into qualitative research practices at RAND is characterized by a dual imperative: leveraging AI for efficiency and scale in routine, labor-intensive tasks, while simultaneously navigating significant challenges related to accuracy, trust, ethical implications, and institutional inertia. While AI offers transformative potential for data management, analysis, and dissemination, its 'black box' nature and propensity for 'hallucinations' necessitate a human-in-the-loop approach to preserve methodological rigor, nuance, and the 'intimacy' with data crucial for generating credible insights. Successful adoption hinges on a strategic institutional roadmap that prioritizes targeted training, clear ethical guidelines, and a shift towards viewing AI as a 'Co-researcher' or 'better button' rather than a complete replacement for human expertise, particularly in complex, context-dependent research domains.

## Methodology

### LLM-Native Qualitative Coding Approach

This analysis employed an innovative methodology that leverages Large Language Models' ability to process entire datasets simultaneously, rather than traditional iterative coding approaches.

**Key Innovation:** Instead of processing interviews sequentially, we loaded all 18 interviews (127,738 words total) into a single analysis context, enabling:
- Global pattern recognition across the entire dataset
- Consistent code application without drift
- Immediate identification of contradictions and tensions
- Natural theoretical saturation detection

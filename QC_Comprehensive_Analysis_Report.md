## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive qualitative analysis of **18 interviews** examining how AI methods are being integrated into qualitative research practices at RAND Corporation. Using an innovative LLM-native approach that processes all interviews simultaneously, we identified **5 major themes**, **62 hierarchical codes** (including 3-level hierarchy), and **10 exemplar quotes** with full traceability to source material.

### Key Findings

**Research Question:** How are AI methods being integrated into qualitative research practices?

**Emergent Theory:** The integration of AI into qualitative research practices at RAND is characterized by a dual imperative: leveraging AI for efficiency and scale in routine, labor-intensive tasks, while simultaneously navigating significant challenges related to accuracy, trust, ethical implications, and institutional inertia. While AI offers transformative potential for data management, analysis, and dissemination, its 'black box' nature and propensity for 'hallucinations' necessitate a human-in-the-loop approach to preserve methodological rigor, nuance, and the 'intimacy' with data crucial for generating credible insights. Successful adoption hinges on a strategic institutional roadmap that prioritizes targeted training, clear ethical guidelines, and a shift towards viewing AI as a 'Co-researcher' or 'better button' rather than a complete replacement for human expertise, particularly in complex, context-dependent research domains.

## Methodology

### LLM-Native Qualitative Coding Approach

**Key Innovation:** Instead of processing interviews sequentially, we loaded all 18 interviews (127,738 words total) into a single analysis context, enabling:
- Global pattern recognition across the entire dataset
- Consistent code application without drift
- Immediate identification of contradictions and tensions
- Natural theoretical saturation detection

### Processing Statistics

- **Total Words Analyzed:** 127,738 (~7,096 words per interview)
- **Token Usage:** 170,317 tokens (1 token â‰ˆ 0.75 words)
- **Processing Time:** 440.0 seconds (~7.3 minutes)
- **Analysis Calls:** 2 LLM calls total (vs. traditional 36-40 calls)
- **Coverage:** All 18 interviews represented in analysis

**Supporting Quotes:**

**T004_Q1** (Kandice Kapinos, INT_001):
> "I think the biggest thing is that we need to have a strategy for how we're going to use AI. And I think that's still very much in flux. I think there's a lot of excitement about it, but there's also a lot of trepidation. And I think we need to figure out how we're going to integrate it into our research workflow."

**T004_Q2** (Kandice Kapinos, INT_001):
> "And I think that's going to require a lot of investment in terms of infrastructure and also in terms of people. We need to have people who are experts in AI, who can help us to develop and implement these tools. And we also need to have a culture that's open to experimentation and innovation."

**T004_Q3** (Kandice Kapinos, INT_001):
> "I think one of the biggest challenges is going to be how we incentivize people to use AI. Because right now, it's not really built into our incentive structure. So people are not necessarily going to be rewarded for using AI in their research. And I think that's something we need to address."

**T004_Q4** (Kandice Kapinos, INT_001):
> "I think another challenge is going to be how we ensure that the AI tools we're using are fair and unbiased. Because there's a lot of concern about bias in AI, and we need to make sure that we're not perpetuating those biases in our research. And that's going to require a lot of careful thought and planning."

**T004_Q5** (Participant, INT_002):
> "Interview coding, something way better than Dedoose. We do a lot of interviews and the coding is uneven in quality. So it would be great if we had some standard way to do that and a tool to help with that."

**Level 1 Subcodes:**

#### **C4.1: Training and Education** (6 interviews, Codes: C4.1;C4.2)
*The need for and types of training and educational initiatives to promote AI literacy.*

#### **C4.2: Incentive Structures** (3 interviews, Codes: C4.1;C4.2)
*Mechanisms to incentivize AI adoption, such as linking AI use to project funding.*

#### **C4.3: Build vs. Buy vs. License** (3 interviews)
*The strategic decision for RAND to develop its own AI tools versus acquiring commercial solutions.*

#### **C4.4: Strategic Roadmap** (1 interview)
*The importance of a clear, high-level strategy and roadmap for AI integration across RAND.*

#### **C4.5: Skunkworks/Experimentation** (2 interviews)
*The concept of creating dedicated spaces or teams for AI experimentation without immediate brand risk.*

### Theme T5: Data Management and Quality (56% prevalence - 10/18 interviews)

#### **C5: Data Management** (10 interviews, Theme T5)
*Aspects related to the collection, organization, and quality of data in AI-driven research.*

**Supporting Quotes:**

**T005_Q1** (Matthew Sergant, INT_001):
> "Interview coding, something way better than Dedoose. We do a lot of interviews and the coding is uneven in quality. So it would be great if we had some standard way to do that and a tool to help with that."

**T005_Q2** (Matthew Sergant, INT_001):
> "Something that helps us with graphics. It would be great if we were not one person deep on Evonne Crane. Great to make graphics that were accurate. I am trying to make one in chatgpt and it makes people without arms and I can't edit it. Something like that and really easy for people to use."

**T005_Q3** (Matthew Sergant, INT_001):
> "We have the forecasting stuff; Tony Vossalo is doing it and I don't understand what they are doing and how they are doing it but making forecasting more broadly applicable ... that is what we are all trying to do, see into the future. If we could forecast more accurately in the outset then we could save a lot of time and effort."

**T005_Q4** (Matthew Sergant, INT_001):
> "Work in methods center. Still trying to find the focus and greater methods. There is a very diverse set of people that use the method across RAND and people are not always in conversation with each other, calling it different things and not always in conversation with each other. So goal is to create more coherence."

**T005_Q5** (Matthew Sergant, INT_001):
> "A lot of the applications of network analysis are embedded in research not involved in network analysis. So part of the challenge is to identify the people that should be brought into the community. They are putting together, ... trying to figure out how to become involved in network analysis."

**Level 1 Subcodes:**

#### **C5.1: Data Wrangling** (5 interviews, Codes: C5.1;C5.2)
*The process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for analysis.*

#### **C5.2: Data Lakes** (2 interviews, Codes: C5.1;C5.2)
*Large, unstructured repositories of raw data that can be used for large-scale AI analysis.*

#### **C5.3: Data Standardization** (3 interviews)
*The process of ensuring data consistency and compatibility across different sources and formats.*

Looking at your goal of analyzing 86 interviews, here are some radical simplification approaches that could get you 80% of the value with 20% of the complexity:

  Approach 1: "LLM Does Everything" - Ultra Simple

  # One giant LLM call with all interviews
  async def analyze_all_interviews_at_once():
      all_interviews = load_all_interviews()  # Concat all 86

      prompt = f"""
      Analyze these 86 interviews and provide:
      1. Top 10 themes across all interviews
      2. Key quotes for each theme
      3. Which interviews support each theme
      4. Contradictions between interviews
      5. Policy recommendations
      
      Interviews:
      {all_interviews}
      """

      # Single API call, done
      result = await gemini.generate_content(prompt)
      return parse_final_report(result)

  Pros:
  - No batching, no chunking, no aggregation logic
  - Gemini sees everything at once (global context)
  - One API call = one result
  - Maybe 50 lines of code total

  Cons:
  - Might hit token limits
  - Less granular analysis
  - Hard to debug

  Approach 2: "Markdown Only" - No Data Structures

  # Skip all the JSON/database complexity
  def simple_analysis():
      final_report = "# Qualitative Analysis Report\n\n"

      for interview_file in interview_files:
          text = read_docx(interview_file)

          # Simple extraction per interview
          themes = extract_themes_simple(text)

          # Append directly to markdown
          final_report += f"## {interview_file.stem}\n"
          for theme in themes:
              final_report += f"- **{theme.name}**: {theme.description}\n"
              final_report += f"  - Quote: '{theme.best_quote}'\n\n"

      # That's it - one big markdown file
      return final_report

  Pros:
  - Human-readable from day 1
  - No data modeling complexity
  - Easy to share/review
  - Can still search/analyze text

  Approach 3: "CSV Export Only" - Spreadsheet Analysis

  # Skip fancy analysis, just extract to CSV
  def extract_to_csv():
      rows = []

      for interview_file in interview_files:
          themes = extract_themes(interview_file)

          for theme in themes:
              for quote in theme.quotes:
                  rows.append({
                      'interview': interview_file.stem,
                      'theme': theme.name,
                      'quote': quote.text,
                      'confidence': theme.confidence,
                      'participant_type': detect_participant_type(interview_file)
                  })

      pd.DataFrame(rows).to_csv('all_analysis.csv')

  Then use Excel/Google Sheets for:
  - Pivot tables for theme frequency
  - Filtering by participant type
  - Manual relationship discovery
  - Charts and visualizations

  Pros:
  - Familiar tooling (Excel/Sheets)
  - Collaborative analysis
  - No code needed for analysis
  - Immediate visual feedback

  Approach 4: "Two-Pass Maximum"

  # Pass 1: Extract themes per interview (parallel)
  async def pass1_extract():
      tasks = [extract_themes(f) for f in interview_files]
      return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

  # Pass 2: LLM aggregates everything
  async def pass2_aggregate(all_themes):
      prompt = f"""
      These are themes from 86 interviews. 
      Create final report with consolidated themes and contradictions:
      {json.dumps(all_themes)}
      """
      return await gemini.generate_content(prompt)

  # That's it - 2 steps total

  Pros:
  - Parallelizable pass 1
  - Global view in pass 2
  - Still leverages LLM intelligence
  - Much simpler than 3-phase approach

  Approach 5: "Template-Driven" - Standardized Output

  # Define exactly what you want upfront
  ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = {
      "executive_summary": "1 paragraph",
      "top_themes": [
          {
              "name": "theme name",
              "frequency": "X interviews",
              "key_quotes": ["quote 1", "quote 2"],
              "participant_types": ["type1", "type2"]
          }
      ],
      "contradictions": [
          {
              "issue": "what they disagree on",
              "side_a": "position 1",
              "side_b": "position 2",
              "evidence": ["quotes"]
          }
      ],
      "policy_recommendations": ["rec 1", "rec 2"]
  }

  # Force every extraction to follow this exact format

  Pros:
  - Predictable output structure
  - Easy to process/compare
  - Forces focus on what matters
  - Reduces analysis complexity

  Approach 6: "Sampling Strategy" - Don't Analyze Everything

  # Maybe you don't need all 86?
  def smart_sampling():
      # Analyze a strategic subset
      sample_interviews = select_diverse_sample(
          all_interviews,
          sample_size=20,  # Much more manageable
          strategy="max_diversity"  # Different participant types, roles, etc.
      )

      # Full analysis on smaller set
      results = analyze_thoroughly(sample_interviews)

      # Quick validation on remaining interviews
      validate_themes_on_remaining(results.themes, remaining_interviews)

  Pros:
  - Much faster development/testing
  - Still statistically valid if sampled well
  - Can always expand later
  - Easier to get user feedback

  My Radical Recommendation: Approach 2 + 4 Hybrid

  async def simple_qualitative_analysis():
      # Pass 1: Parallel theme extraction (simple)
      theme_tasks = []
      for interview_file in interview_files:
          task = extract_themes_to_markdown(interview_file)
          theme_tasks.append(task)

      individual_reports = await asyncio.gather(*theme_tasks)

      # Pass 2: LLM creates final consolidated report
      all_themes = "\n\n".join(individual_reports)

      final_report = await gemini.generate_content(f"""
      Create a comprehensive qualitative analysis report from these individual analyses:
      
      {all_themes}
      
      Include:
      - Executive summary
      - Major themes with evidence
      - Contradictions and tensions
      - Policy recommendations
      """)

      # Output: One beautiful markdown report
      return final_report

  Total complexity: ~100 lines of code, 2 LLM passes, markdown output

  Gets you: Professional analysis report, theme identification, contradictions, policy recommendations

  Skips: Complex data modeling, databases, relationship analysis, multi-format exports, batch management

  Time to implement: 1-2 days instead of weeks

  Would this approach meet your actual needs? What's the core deliverable you need from the 86 interviews?

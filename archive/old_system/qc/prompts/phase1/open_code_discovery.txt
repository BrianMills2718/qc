You are analyzing {num_interviews} interviews to discover thematic codes.

ANALYTIC QUESTION: {analytic_question}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read through ALL interviews comprehensively
2. Identify major themes and sub-themes related to the analytic question
3. Create a hierarchical code structure with up to {code_hierarchy_depth} levels
4. Each code MUST have these fields:
   - id: Unique ID in CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES format (e.g., "AI_CHALLENGES", "DATA_QUALITY_ISSUES")
   - name: Clear name (human-readable version, e.g., "AI Challenges", "Data Quality Issues")
   - description: Detailed description (2-3 sentences explaining the code)
   - semantic_definition: Clear definition of what qualifies for this code
   - parent_id: ID of parent code (null for top-level codes)
   - level: Hierarchy level (0 for top-level, 1 for second level, etc.)
   - example_quotes: List of 1-3 quotes that best illustrate this code
   - discovery_confidence: Float between 0.0 and 1.0

5. Hierarchy structure:
   - Level 0: Main themes (no parent_id)
   - Level 1: Sub-themes (parent_id points to level 0 code)
   - Level 2: Detailed codes (parent_id points to level 1 code)

6. Codes should be:
   - Mutually distinct (minimize overlap between codes)
   - Directly relevant to the analytic question
   - Grounded in actual interview content (not theoretical)

# Advanced LLM-Based Qualitative Analysis Modules Plan
# Date: 2025-08-23
# Status: Planning Phase

## 1. ANALYTICAL MEMOS MODULE
- **Purpose**: LLM-generated analytical memos during coding process
- **Implementation**: 
  - Capture emerging insights, theoretical connections, analytical thinking
  - Generate memos linking codes to emerging theoretical concepts
  - Track researcher's evolving understanding
- **Traditional Basis**: Standard grounded theory practice
- **Innovation**: Automated memo generation with LLM analytical perspectives

## 2. PARADIGM-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS MODULE  
- **Purpose**: Configurable theoretical lens application
- **Implementation**:
  - Paradigm configuration system (phenomenological, critical theory, constructivist, feminist, postmodern)
  - Injectable paradigm variables into analysis prompts
  - Multi-perspective analysis of same data
- **Output**: Analysis results from different theoretical perspectives
- **Value**: Reveals insights that single-paradigm analysis might miss

## 3. PROCESS MAPPING MODULE
- **Purpose**: Extract sequential processes from narrative data
- **Implementation Approach**: 
  - INNOVATIVE/COMPUTATIONAL (not standard qualitative practice)
  - Create DAG-like structures from interview narratives
  - Node types: events, states, decisions, outcomes
  - Edge types: temporal ("then"), causal, conditional, concurrent
- **Example**: "First tried ChatGPT ’ Problem discovered ’ Adaptation ’ New usage pattern"
- **Challenge**: Distinguish formal process structures from narrative descriptions
- **Note**: This would be pioneering rather than replicating established practice

## 4. CHANGE MECHANISM DETECTION MODULE
- **Purpose**: Identify what triggers shifts in narratives/experiences
- **Relationship to Process Mapping**: 
  - Could be embedded in processes (specific trigger nodes/edges)
  - Could be cross-cutting patterns across different processes  
  - Could be meta-analysis of change patterns
- **Traditional Basis**: "Critical incidents" and "turning points" analysis
- **Implementation**: Detect phrases indicating change, identify triggers and outcomes

## 5. CONTRADICTION MAPPING MODULE
- **Purpose**: Automatically detect internal contradictions in participant narratives
- **Types of Contradictions**:
  - Logical: "I trust AI" + "I don't trust AI"
  - Behavioral: "I'm skeptical" + [uses daily] 
  - Temporal: Position changes over time
  - Contextual: Different stances for different uses
- **Challenge**: Distinguish contradictions from nuanced/sophisticated positions
- **Value**: Reveals complexity in participant experiences and potential areas for deeper exploration

## 6. ENHANCED AUDIT TRAIL MODULE
- **Current Status**: 
  -  QCA calibration decisions logged
  -  Outcome calculation steps documented
  -  Methodology compliance tracking
- **Missing Components**:
  - L Pattern recognition module (needs to be built)
  - L Coding decision rationale logging  
  - L Alternative interpretation tracking
  - L Theme identification audit trail
- **Implementation Needed**:
  - Pattern recognition infrastructure
  - Decision rationale capture
  - Alternative consideration logging

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES
1. **Analytical Memos Module** - Extends existing coding, high value, standard practice basis
2. **Paradigm-Specific Analysis** - Configurable, clear implementation path, immediate value
3. **Contradiction Mapping** - Novel, high analytical value, manageable scope
4. **Enhanced Audit Trail** - Build pattern recognition foundation for other modules
5. **Process Mapping** - Experimental, requires significant infrastructure development  
6. **Change Mechanism Detection** - Depends on process mapping infrastructure

## TECHNICAL NOTES
- Most approaches would be INNOVATIVE/COMPUTATIONAL rather than following established qualitative traditions
- Field is narrative/interpretive rather than formal/structural  
- We'd be pioneering rather than replicating standard practice
- Need to build pattern recognition infrastructure before implementing advanced modules

## EXCLUDED APPROACHES (Decided Against)
- Dynamic concept networks (too complex, static networks sufficient)
- Member checking automation (not desired)
- Multi-perspective narrative analysis (covered by paradigm-specific analysis)
- Longitudinal pattern mining (not applicable to current single-time-point data)
- Network-based concept analysis (semantic networks already exist)
- Real-time adaptive interviewing (not applicable to existing data)
- Predictive qualitative modeling (outside current scope)

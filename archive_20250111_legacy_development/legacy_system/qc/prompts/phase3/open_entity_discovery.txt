You are analyzing {num_interviews} interviews to discover entity types and relationships.

ANALYTIC QUESTION: {analytic_question}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ENTITY TYPES: Identify categories of things discussed in the interviews
   - Each entity type needs:
     * id: Type ID in CAPS_SNAKE_CASE format (e.g., "AI_TOOL", "ORGANIZATION", "RESEARCH_METHOD")
     * name: Human-readable name (e.g., "AI Tool", "Organization", "Research Method")
     * Clear definition of what qualifies as this type
     * 2-3 concrete examples from the interviews
     * Why this type matters for the analytic question
     * Confidence score (0.0-1.0)

2. RELATIONSHIP TYPES: Identify how entities connect or interact
   - Each relationship type needs:
     * id: Type ID in CAPS format (e.g., "USES", "MANAGES", "BELONGS_TO", "IMPACTS")
     * name: Human-readable name (e.g., "Uses", "Manages", "Belongs To", "Impacts")
     * Clear definition of this relationship
     * Valid source entity type(s) that can have this relationship
     * Valid target entity type(s) that can receive this relationship
     * Direction: one-way (→) or bidirectional (↔)
     * 1-2 examples from the interviews

3. Focus on entities and relationships that:
   - Are explicitly discussed in the interviews
   - Directly relate to the analytic question
   - Appear multiple times or are emphasized as important

INTERVIEW CONTENT:
{combined_text}

Return a JSON object with:

- total_entities_found: integer count
- total_relationships_found: integer count
- discovery_method: "open"
- extraction_confidence: float between 0.0 and 1.0

Each entity type object MUST have:
- id: string in CAPS_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., "AI_TOOL")
- name: human-readable string (e.g., "AI Tool")
- description: string describing what qualifies
- frequency: integer count of how often mentioned
- example_entities: array of example entity names
- common_contexts: array of contexts where it appears
- confidence: float between 0.0 and 1.0

Each relationship type object MUST have:
- id: string in CAPS (e.g., "USES")
- name: human-readable string (e.g., "Uses")
- description: string describing the relationship
- frequency: integer count of occurrences

- common_target_types: array of entity type IDs that can be target
- directional: boolean (true for one-way, false for bidirectional)
- example_relationships: array of example relationship objects
- confidence: float between 0.0 and 1.0

Each example relationship object has:

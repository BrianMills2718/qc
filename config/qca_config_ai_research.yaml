    calibration:
      method: "frequency" 
      theoretical_justification: "Frequency-based calibration reflects literature on AI adoption phases: experimental (rare), regular (moderate), integrated (frequent). Thresholds based on Rogers' Innovation Diffusion Theory."

    calibration:
      method: "binary"
      theoretical_justification: "Binary threshold based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM): repeated mentions (2+) indicate perceived usefulness as primary adoption driver rather than incidental mention."

    calibration:
      method: "frequency"

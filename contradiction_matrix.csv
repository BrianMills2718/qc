CONT_001,Impact of AI on Researcher Roles and Skill Development,AI will displace junior researchers and negatively impact skill development.,Molly Dunnigan (Arroyo SDR); Patricia Herman (REACH Center); Dulani Woods (Scalable Computing),Molly Dunnigan: 'The risk is that we will end up utilizing AI for stuff our junior folks used to do. We can use AI for a literature review that would have taken a RA 20 days so benefits of cost savings but I worry about career development and skillset development among the younger folks.' (Interview,"Patricia Herman: 'If heading toward AI… where you you have the model do the analysis, then that is negative impact on training.' (Interview 008)","AI will free up researchers from tedious tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-value work.",Lisa Saum-Manning (ISDP); Heather Williams (ISDP); Christopher Mouton (ISDP),"Lisa Saum-Manning: 'I would love a finding of this, Todd to be like, OK. We figured out the things that AI can do. What can't they do so that when all of our jobs are under threat, that AI is taking over? Like what do we do better? What can it ultimately you still need us?' (Interview 010)","Heather Williams: 'And I appreciate Chris's point of like rather than trying to have it do our jobs, which we probably can only do best, why doesn't it create efficiencies for us and all of the NIM picky things that pull us away from our jobs?' (Interview 010)","The potential for AI to displace junior roles is a significant concern, but many also see it as an opportunity to automate 'nim picky' or 'grunt work,' allowing researchers to focus on higher-level analytical and creative tasks. The challenge lies in ensuring that foundational skills are still developed and that AI is used as a 'better button' rather than an 'easy button.'",T2; T3,C2.2.3; C3.1
CONT_002,Reliability and Trustworthiness of AI Outputs,"AI output is often unreliable, prone to hallucinations, and requires extensive human verification, negating efficiency gains.",Ramya Chari (Qualitative Researcher); Sara McCleskey (Health Researcher); David Klein (Statistical Analyst); Amy Shearer (Behavioral Scientist); Keith Crane (Economist); Lisa Saum-Manning (ISDP),"Ramya Chari: 'I was finding that it was it was difficult for me to like a just inherently trust what it was spitting out... there were definitely, like, nuances that were missed and things that, you know were not picked up that were relevant to our project.' (Interview 001)","David Klein: 'I usually almost always get the wrong answer from AI. It almost always gives me code that is doesn't exist is incorrect, but it often gives me code that is on the right path that I might not have figured out on my own. So it gives me the right procedure or the right. Set of options and","AI tools, while imperfect, can significantly enhance quality and efficiency, especially with proper prompting and iteration.",Ryan Brown (Qualitative Researcher); Julia Kaufman (Qualitative Researcher); Caroline Johnston (Operations Researcher); Andrew Morral (Statistical Analyst); Laurie Martin (QA Manager),"Ryan Brown: 'What I've seen with Muse. Is that yes, there are still some weaknesses with sometimes over interpretation of excerpts or under interpretation, inability to notice subtleties in sarcasm or phrasing. Is that because it's so much faster you can load? Way and analyze way more documents.' (I","Caroline Johnston: 'AI has been really helpful with writing like any type of code... it just helped me write code like so much faster. And of course checking that it's correct as well, which sometimes is not always done when people use llm's for example.' (Interview 003)","There is a consensus that AI outputs require human verification due to hallucination and nuance issues. However, proponents argue that with proper training, iterative prompting, and integration into a human-in-the-loop workflow, AI can still provide substantial efficiency and quality gains, acting as a 'tireless research assistant' or 'Co-researcher.' The key is to define 'good enough' and establish clear validation protocols.",T2; T3,C2.1.1; C2.1.4; C3.4
CONT_003,RAND's Approach to AI Tool Development: Build vs. Buy,RAND should primarily invest in building its own proprietary AI tools to maintain competitive advantage and control.,Molly Dunnigan (Arroyo SDR); Eric Peltz (Forecasting),Molly Dunnigan: 'My sense is the Army thinks our competitors are integrating AI wholistically... So how do we make sure we don’t get put out of business in that environment. How do we maintain a competitive edge. There are ways we do that to develop propriety tools but that day is coming very quickl,"Eric Peltz: 'He wants us to do it all at once because he wants a Rand version of it. So instead of asking them to change things for us, we're we're gonna go to them at some point and say, here's I don't know, $200,000 or something. Make all these changes and then that would become at some level Rand","RAND should focus on deploying and integrating best-of-breed commercial AI tools rather than building its own, due to internal limitations and rapid external advancements.",Jim Mitre (GER Leadership); Matan Chorev (GER Leadership); Brandon De Bruhl (Statistical Analyst); Andrew Morral (Statistical Analyst),"Jim Mitre: 'I put 99% of the effort on applying best of breed from the private sector and bringing it to Rand and not trying to like build our own cause a we're not particularly good at software development, B, even if we do build it, who's gonna main? It and upkeep it and keep it stateoftheart over","Matan Chorev: 'And they have a team of people who are, you know, have a stake in the company's future profitability. And so therefore, we'll update maintain patch service that software as opposed to us.' (Interview 007)","There's a tension between the desire for proprietary tools to maintain a competitive edge and the practical challenges of building and maintaining state-of-the-art AI capabilities internally. Many argue that RAND's strength is not software development, and it would be more efficient to leverage rapidly evolving commercial tools, focusing instead on how to best apply and integrate them within RAND's unique research context, especially for CUI/classified data.",T2; T4,C2.3.1; C4.3

CONT_001,AI's ability to replace human analytical depth,AI cannot replace human researchers' nuanced understanding and contextual analysis.,Joie Acosta; Ramya Chari; Sara McCleskey; Nathan Beauchamp-Mustafaga; Patricia Herman; Elaine Wang; Alice Huguet; Heather Williams; David Metz; Dan Penoyer; Brittany Clayton,"Joie Acosta: ""AI can't replace us in reading transcripts and understanding the context behind the interview in understanding the conversation."" (Interview 001)","Ramya Chari: ""there were definitely, like, nuances that were missed and things that, you know were not picked up that were relevant to our project."" (Interview 001)","AI can perform complex analytical tasks, including synthesis and idea generation, potentially surpassing human capabilities in speed and scale.",Luke Matthews; Ryan Brown; Julia Kaufman; Jim Mitre; Matan Chorev; Anthony Vassalo; Dulani Woods,"Luke Matthews: ""I've been using some of the LLM's for... thematic coding and kind of ability to kind of group documents then generate text for me."" (Interview 001)","Ryan Brown: ""I've seen it take essentially what would be like a 20 days of Labor task and turn it into a one day of Labor task for one individual."" (Interview 004)","Many suggest a hybrid approach where AI augments human researchers, handling rote tasks and providing initial insights, while humans provide critical oversight, validate results, and add nuanced interpretation. The concept of AI as a 'co-researcher' or 'tireless research assistant' is proposed.",THEME_001; THEME_002; THEME_003,CODE_002; CODE_003; CODE_012; CODE_015; CODE_016; CODE_020; CODE_061
CONT_002,RAND's approach to AI tool development and acquisition,RAND should primarily focus on acquiring and integrating best-of-breed commercial AI tools rather than building its own.,Jim Mitre; Matan Chorev; Andrew Morral; Brandon De Bruhl,"Jim Mitre: ""I put 99% of the effort on applying best of breed from the private sector and bringing it to Rand and not trying to like build our own cause a we're not particularly good at software development."" (Interview 007)","Matan Chorev: ""every other company has these things at the desktop... it's not a corporate investment that is universally available."" (Interview 007)","RAND should invest in developing its own specialized AI tools tailored to its unique research needs and data, such as Muse or Ask Rand.",Todd Helmus (implied by questions about Muse); Ryan Brown; Julia Kaufman; Prateek Puri (developer of Muse); Eric Peltz (mentioned by Anthony Vassalo),"Todd Helmus: ""RAND has a product to help on the coding side. Right muse."" (Interview 001)","Ryan Brown: ""What I've seen with Muse... is that yes, there are still some weaknesses... but it's so much faster you can load. Way and analyze way more documents."" (Interview 004)","A potential middle ground involves licensing commercial tools for general tasks while selectively developing bespoke tools for RAND's unique, sensitive, or highly specialized data/methods, ensuring these internal tools are maintained and updated.",THEME_004; THEME_002,CODE_041; CODE_038; CODE_002
CONT_003,The value and future of traditional literature reviews,"Traditional, comprehensive literature reviews are becoming less relevant to sponsors and are inefficient, suggesting a shift towards more policy-focused or AI-assisted approaches.",Timothy Gulden; Laurie Martin; Tom LaTourrette; Molly Dunnigan,"Timothy Gulden: ""I feel like some projects. I've done the literature review. Happens because there needs to be a literature review... But it's not really critical to the project succeeding or not."" (Interview 009)","Molly Dunnigan: ""The risk is that we will end up utilizing AI for stuff our junior folks used to do. We can use AI for a literature review that would have taken a RA 20 days so benefits of cost savings."" (Interview 002)","Literature reviews remain a fundamental and critical component of research, essential for establishing context, identifying gaps, and ensuring comprehensive understanding, even if AI can assist.",Joie Acosta; Ramya Chari; Luke Matthews; Eunice Wong; Amy Shearer; Nathan Beauchamp-Mustafaga; John Hollywood; Dulani Woods,"Joie Acosta: ""I always have to rely on the librarian for. It's like all of the search strategy stuff."" (Interview 001)","Eunice Wong: ""I guess I think of literature review at the very, very beginning like trying to secure funding... trying to find that gap and where you can be innovative and that takes a lot of work."" (Interview 009)","AI is seen as a tool to make literature reviews more efficient (e.g., searching, summarizing, filtering), allowing researchers to focus on higher-level synthesis, gap identification, and policy relevance. The debate shifts from 'if' to 'how' AI can best support this essential research component.",THEME_001; THEME_005,CODE_008; CODE_007; CODE_009; CODE_020; CODE_026

# Critical Readiness Assessment - Potential Failure Points

## ðŸš¨ Critical Uncertainties That Could Derail Implementation

### 1. **The "NO CHUNKING" Assumption is Untested**

**What we assume**: Gemini 2.5 Flash can handle 500K+ token interviews without chunking
**What we DON'T know**: 
- Does the 60K output limit mean we lose themes if there are too many?
- What happens when an interview has 200+ distinct codes?
- How does Gemini perform with 800K tokens in practice?

**MUST TEST BEFORE PROCEEDING**:
```python
# Test with actual large interview
large_interview = read_file("fixtures/interviews/largest_interview.docx")
print(f"Tokens: {estimate_tokens(large_interview)}")
response = gemini_client.extract_themes(large_interview)
# Does it timeout? Truncate? Lose quality?
```

### 2. **The QC Extractor Integration is Unclear**

**What exists**: `qualitative_coding_extractor.py` with 3-phase coding
**What's unclear**:
- Does it actually call the Gemini client or is it just prompts?
- The inheritance from SimpleGeminiExtractor - does this work?
- Where does the actual API call happen?

**MUST VERIFY**:
```python
# Can we actually run this?
extractor = QualitativeCodingExtractor()
result = await extractor.perform_qualitative_coding(interview_text)
# Or is this incomplete?
```

### 3. **Interview Parser Complexity Underestimated**

**What we assume**: "Just extract text from DOCX"
**What we're missing**:
- Interview transcripts have structure (timestamps, speakers, sections)
- Focus groups have multiple speakers - how to preserve?
- Some interviews have tables, images, footnotes
- Line numbers for quotes - how to preserve from DOCX?

**Real interview complexity**:
```
[00:15:23] Interviewer: Can you describe your experience?
[00:15:45] Participant A: Well, it's complicated...
[00:16:02] Participant B: I disagree with A because...
[Break in recording]
[00:18:30] Interviewer: Let's continue...
```

How do we preserve this structure for accurate quote attribution?

### 4. **The Three-Phase Coding Process**

**Big uncertainty**: Does this actually work with one API call?
```python
OPEN_CODING_PROMPT = "..." # Extract codes
AXIAL_CODING_PROMPT = "..." # Find relationships
SELECTIVE_CODING_PROMPT = "..." # Core category
```

**Questions**:
- Do we make 3 separate API calls? (3x cost, 3x time)
- Or combine into one mega-prompt? (complexity, token limits)
- How do we pass results between phases?
- What if phase 2 contradicts phase 1?

### 5. **Output Format Assumptions**

**What we specified**: Beautiful markdown reports
**What we don't know**:
- How to automatically determine quote line numbers from raw text
- How to handle overlapping codes on same segment
- How to visualize theme hierarchies in text
- How to track codebook evolution across interviews

**Example problem**:
```python
# Quote in JSON response
"quote": "I don't trust remote work"
# Where is this in the original? Line 234? 567? 
# How do we map back?
```

### 6. **Batch Processing State Management**

**What we assume**: Process 5 interviews concurrently
**What we're missing**:
- What if interview 3 has amazing new codes?
- Do we update the codebook mid-batch?
- How do we ensure consistency across concurrent processing?
- What about theme evolution - frozen or dynamic?

### 7. **The LLM Response Format Problem**

**Critical issue**: Gemini 2.5 Flash with `response_mime_type='application/json'`
**Questions**:
- Does it ACTUALLY enforce valid JSON?
- What if the response is truncated at 60K tokens?
- Do we get partial JSON we can recover?
- How do we validate the response matches our schema?

**Must test**:
```python
# Will this return valid JSON every time?
response = await client.generate_content(
    prompt,
    generation_config={"response_mime_type": "application/json"}
)
# Or do we still need robust parsing?
```

### 8. **Performance and Cost Reality**

**Assumptions**:
- 2 minutes per interview
- $X per interview
- Memory usage reasonable

**Unknown**:
- Actual Gemini 2.5 Flash response time for 500K tokens
- Cost for 500K input + 60K output tokens
- Memory usage when processing 10 interviews concurrently
- Rate limits we'll hit

### 9. **The CLI Integration Mystery**

We keep saying "rewire CLI" but:
- How exactly does current CLI work?
- What commands does it expect?
- How much of the existing CLI can we reuse?
- What about progress display for long operations?

### 10. **Missing Domain Knowledge**

**We're assuming** we understand qualitative coding, but:
- When should codes be merged vs kept separate?
- How to handle negative cases?
- What constitutes theoretical saturation?
- How to track inter-rater reliability (if multiple coders)?

---

## ðŸ›‘ STOP: Must Resolve Before Proceeding

### 1. **Run Actual Integration Test**
```python
# TODAY - Test the core assumption
from qc.core.qualitative_coding_extractor import QualitativeCodingExtractor

extractor = QualitativeCodingExtractor()
test_interview = open("test_interview.txt").read()

# Does this actually work?
result = await extractor.perform_qualitative_coding(test_interview)
print(result)
```

### 2. **Test Large Interview Handling**
```python
# Find the largest interview
# Test if NO CHUNKING actually works
# Measure time, cost, quality
```

### 3. **Clarify Three-Phase Implementation**
- One call or three?
- How to pass context between phases?
- Token usage for each approach?

### 4. **Test JSON Response Reliability**
```python
# Send 10 test prompts
# Check if JSON is always valid
# Test truncation handling
```

### 5. **Create Realistic Test Data**
Not just any text file, but:
- Structured interview with timestamps
- Multiple speakers
- 100K+ tokens
- Complex formatting

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Action

**DO NOT START BUILDING YET**

Instead, spend 1 day on "Reality Testing":

1. **Hour 1-2**: Test if QualitativeCodingExtractor actually runs
2. **Hour 3-4**: Test Gemini with a 500K token interview  
3. **Hour 5-6**: Test JSON response format reliability
4. **Hour 7-8**: Create realistic test interview with all complexity

**Only proceed if**:
- Core integration works
- Large interviews process without chunking
- JSON responses are reliable
- We understand the three-phase process

The biggest risk is building on untested assumptions. One day of testing could save weeks of rework.

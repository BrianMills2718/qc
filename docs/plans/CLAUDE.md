# Implementation Plans

Track all implementation work here.

## Active Plans

| # | Name | Priority | Status | Plan doc |
|---|------|----------|--------|----------|

No active implementation plan tracked. Next up: the claim ledger (INV-9).

## Completed Plans

| Name | Outcome | Record |
|------|---------|--------|
| INV-1 span anchoring + harness Phase 0 | INV-1 mostly met; `make bench` Phase 0 stood up | `completed/INV1_OVERNIGHT_SPRINT.md` |
| INV-8 segment universe + exhaustive coding | INV-8 met in exhaustive mode (`--exhaustive`); coverage denominator | `completed/INV8_SEGMENT_UNIVERSE.md` |
| Application-level IRR | `project irr --application-level` reports segment × code agreement | `completed/IRR_APPLICATION_LEVEL.md` |

## Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Planned | Ready to implement |
| In Progress | Being worked on |
| Blocked | Waiting on dependency |
| Complete | Implemented and verified |

## Creating a New Plan

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to a descriptive `NAME.md` (e.g. `INV9_CLAIM_LEDGER.md`)
2. Fill in gap, steps, required tests
3. Add a row to the **Active Plans** table above
4. Commit with a `[Plan: NAME]` prefix

## Trivial Changes

Not everything needs a plan. Use `[Trivial]` for:
- Less than 20 lines changed
- No changes to `src/` (production code)
- No new files created

```bash
git commit -m "[Trivial] Fix typo in README"
```

## Completing Plans

1. Move the plan doc to `completed/NAME.md` (add a one-paragraph outcome + verification evidence at the top)
2. Remove its row from **Active Plans** and add one to **Completed Plans** pointing at `completed/NAME.md`
3. `python scripts/sync_plan_status.py --check` (run by `make docs-check`) verifies every Completed row resolves and every record file is listed

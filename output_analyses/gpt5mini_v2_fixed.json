    "key_themes": [
      "Methods Center role and activities: The Center is described as a convener that hosts seminars, journal clubs, and seed-funds early work — \"I view the Center as a convener of researchers who have expertise in causal inference techniques.\" and \"The center has changed a bit but we host seminars and journal clubs to bring the methods to others and we are experimenting with a few things, using seed funding to help with preproposal work that is done.\"",
      "Common causal methods and reliance on data: RAND researchers rely on observational methods driven by available data; common techniques include DiD, synthetic control, IV, and propensity scores — \"The randomized control trial is our gold standard but they don’t happen that often... First difference-in-difference... Synthetic control methods... Instrumental variables approach... Propensity score match, interrupted timeseries analysis.\" and \"Propensity score is done a ton... Difference in difference is used; some version of that is most frequently used.\"",
      "Practical AI uses — code help: LLMs are actively used to debug, convert, and clean code — \"I have used AI tools to help with my code... I can take the code and put it in an LLM; can you fix this error or can you write this more concisely?\" and \"asked can you convert this R code to Stata code and kept playing with it and learned what is good and not good.\"",
      "Practical AI uses — proposals and design critique: LLMs are used to draft executive summaries, shorten text, and 'poke holes' in study designs — \"I take the whole proposal and say write an executive summary; it is great at doing that; you can’t trust it but sometimes stuff that is off and misses nuance\" and \"I’ve also done things for proposal writing and taken my idea where I want to use a particular design and poke holes in this; What are the problems with this; how can I strengthen this?\"",
      "Practical AI uses — literature review automation: The interviewee scripted RAND Chat to screen thousands of papers and output one-sentence summaries and metadata to support rapid client timelines — \"we did write a python script to use the RAND CHAT to review a bunch of papers... had it spit out in a spreadsheet a once sentence summary of the paper\" and \"the client a federal agency wanted us to do this massive literature review in one month... it was originally 5,000 papers and removed duplicates down to 3500 that it went through.\"",
      "AI limitations and need for verification: LLM outputs can hallucinate or give incorrect citations and require manual checking — \"a couple of times I would ask RAND CHAT... and it would give me papers/citations that were not real. So I always check.\" and \"you can’t trust it but sometimes stuff that is off and misses nuance but it is pretty good at that.\"",
      "IP and ethical concerns: The interviewee differentiates risk by output type — code seen as low-risk, while text and images raise IP/ethics anxiety — \"But a code is code so that not an issue. But if I were to take my proposal and say write this, is it going to take texts from others?\" and \"I don’t want to inadvertently take someone else’s intellectual property... ppl making images... it is kind of stealing.\"",
      "Adoption, barriers, and training needs: Adoption at RAND is described as limited/slower, with policy uncertainty and desire for internal showcases and training — \"Most ppl I ask, at RAND there are not as many ppl using it...\" and \"There could be more along those lines, showcasing how ppl use it successfully... someone super savvy... could give a rundown of how they use it day to day.\"",
      "Data/workflow challenges constrain automation gains: Pulling, cleaning, and preparing data — and heterogeneous storage/APIs — remain time consuming and limit full automation despite API possibilities — \"the time-consuming process of pulling data down, checking code...\" and \"Some federal agencies are using the Api... not all data is saved the same way... a lot of public use data like claims, those are massive datasets so you don’t want to pull down the entire dataset.\""

She is concerned about IP/ethical issues for some outputs, sees adoption at RAND as cautious/slower than elsewhere, and advocates for more training, showcases, and clear policy guidance to increase productive uptake.",

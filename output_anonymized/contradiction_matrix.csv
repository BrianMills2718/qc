CONT_001,Accuracy and Trustworthiness of AI Output,"AI is not accurate enough and misses nuance, requiring extensive human checking that negates efficiency gains.",Ramya Chari; Sara McCleskey; Amy Shearer; David Klein; Caitlin McCulloch; Brian Jackson; Lisa Saum-Manning; Heather Williams; Brittany Clayton; Dan Penoyer,"Ramya Chari: 'we found when you know going back and rereading it, that there were definitely, like, nuances that were missed and things that, you know were not picked up that were relevant to our project.' (Interview 001)",Amy Shearer: 'It will hallucinate things that nobody ever said. And so that's basically that's the human work is we're having to go through and rescan every comment just to make sure that like we have the general gist of it and cross check that with what AI is saying.'

Is that because it's so much faster you can load? Way and analyze way more documents.'

CONT_002,Rand's AI Tool Development Strategy,"Rand should focus on building its own proprietary AI tools, especially for sensitive or niche applications.",Eric Peltz (as described by Anthony Vassalo); Brandon De Bruhl; Jonathan Cantor,"Anthony Vassalo: 'Eric Peltz doesn't. He wants us to do it all at once because he wants a Rand version of it. So instead of asking them to change things for us, we're we're gonna go to them at some point and say, here's I don't know, $200,000 or something. Make all these changes and then that would ","Brandon De Bruhl: 'I just don't think Rand like Ed, Ed guys and I had a conversation about two years ago when when things were really starting to heat up.

CONT_003,AI's Impact on Researcher Roles and Skill Development,"AI poses a threat to junior researcher jobs and the development of fundamental research skills (e.g., coding, deep reading).",Molly Dunnigan; Kimberly Jackson; Patricia Herman; Dulani Woods,Molly Dunnigan: 'The risk is that we will end up utilizing AI for stuff our junior folks used to do. We can use AI for a literature review that would have taken a RA 20 days so benefits of cost savings but I worry about career development and skillset development among the younger folks.' (Interview,"Patricia Herman: 'If heading toward AIâ€¦ where you you have the model do the analysis, then that is negative impact on training.

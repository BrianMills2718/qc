So besides like the auto, I've been doing the kind of machine transcription and stuff, but I've been using some of the LLM's for and kind of more exploring some of their thematic coding and kind of ability to kind of group documents then generate text for me.",

We don't even 22. Different pages that have two different lists of what our resources are.",

Like and I'm gonna beat them on data quality because I get better sources than they do, but like. You know we can't. Structurally, we can't be minor in AI and so.

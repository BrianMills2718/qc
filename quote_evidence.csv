Q001,"I mean, I've taken stuff from ranch at and then I've and and other models and incorporated it to research products. I'll I'll give you an example. The Department of Defense asked us to think about some alternative China scenarios, so I asked the China team and we got some really important and thoughtful ideas from the China team. Some frontier AI models also had some pretty interesting ideas. So our response was a blend of the two, but it can do, you know, quote UN quote creative work or interes...",Unknown,"Jim Mitre, GER leadership",INT_007,,,From interview,,CODE_003; CODE_005; CODE_009,THEME_001,0.9
Q002,"What I've seen with Muse is that yes, there are still some weaknesses with sometimes over interpretation of excerpts or under interpretation, inability to notice subtleties in sarcasm or phrasing. Is that because it's so much faster you can load way and analyze way more documents. So depending what you're looking for, if you're looking for sort of a gist of a pattern and a very large data set, it's just so much quicker. Than it used to be. So I think you can iterate on large data sets much more ...",Unknown,"Ryan Brown, Qualitative Researcher",INT_004,,,From interview,,CODE_002; CODE_004; CODE_005,THEME_001,0.9
Q003,"Like Can you imagine? A world where, like AI could feed in information about the kind of participants you're looking for. And AI could crawl the Internet to find them. Invite them to participate and then find a time on your calendar for the interview. Period.",Unknown,"Joie Acosta, Psychologist",INT_001,,,From interview,,CODE_006; CODE_007; CODE_005,THEME_001,0.9
Q004,"I write a lot of code so the the quant code right we talked about call coding. AI has been really helpful with writing like any type of code I write primarily in Python, and I mentioned right? I'm a new hire, so I joined a project, you know, trying to make a good first impression here at Rand. And they're like, oh, Caroline, you know, P. Like can you do this? And I had no idea how to do this, but I was like, well, I know how to read Python code. I don't know how to, you know, write this from scr...",Unknown,"Caroline Johnston, Associate Operations Researcher",INT_003,,,From interview,,CODE_005; CODE_011,THEME_001,0.9
Q005,"It's a really silly example, but meeting minutes like just having AI transcribed the meeting minutes put it in like here are the key decisions. Here are the action items. Like right now I have an RA do that right. That's if I've been experimenting with having a recording the meeting and having AI do it. But again, I think that's a very simple use case scenario.",Unknown,"Katherine Watkins, Clinician",INT_003,,,From interview,,CODE_001; CODE_003; CODE_005,THEME_001,0.9
Q006,"I mean, I just had the this experience on a project. Where we were using expert lens and expert lenses, integrating AI now to kind of go through and give a synopsis of what everybody says for the different questions or topics that you're asking about. And you know, and and then the synopsis aren't bad. But I was finding that it was it was difficult for me to like a just inherently trust what it was spitting out in a way that maybe you want to just like take it and use it to draw further conclusi...",Unknown,"Ramya Chari, Jack of all trades (Environmental Health/CBPR)",INT_001,,,From interview,,CODE_012; CODE_015; CODE_014,THEME_002,0.9
Q007,"I used Muse once to sort of check we had already coded all the data and so we use it as kind of an additional check and I think I agree with what Ramya has said, like it missed anything that was nuanced. It sort of wasn't picking up on things. I say this as someone who's sort of AI naive like I I'm sure I could have programmed it better or given it better prompts. Or asked in different ways, but at that point I feel like it's faster to just do it myself, so I just feel like it's not quite doing ...",Unknown,"Sara McCleskey, Associate Policy Researcher (Health)",INT_001,,,From interview,,CODE_013; CODE_012; CODE_015; CODE_014,THEME_002,0.9
Q008,"One of the things researchers are increasingly concerned about is data mining, which is going into a data set and just, you know, looking at all these different options. Running 100 running 100 analysis to see which one is that, David, that's. Yeah, yeah. And see which one's the best right. And. And so increasingly, we're guarding against that in some cases by pre filing, you know, an analytic plans that say this is how we are going to use the data. And then when we go to publish, we say. You kn...",Unknown,"Lynn Karoly, Senior Economist",INT_003,,,From interview,,CODE_014,THEME_002,0.9
Q009,The risk is that we will end up utilizing AI for stuff our junior folks used to do. We can use AI for a literature review that would have taken a RA 20 days so benefits of cost savings but I worry about career development and skillset development among the younger folks.,Unknown,"Molly Dunnigan, Arroyo SDR",INT_002,,,From interview,,CODE_014,THEME_002,0.9
Q010,"I mean, I asked Ryan's chat to give me some citations for our Africa work, and I think all four of them are fabricated. So. At least there's no such thing on the Internet with those titles. That really concerns me.",Unknown,"Todd Helmus, Qualitative Researcher",INT_010,,,From interview,,CODE_015; CODE_013; CODE_014,THEME_002,0.9
Q011,"I mean, I am less skeptical, I guess of current capabilities for analysis, which is the most. The most burdensome usually. Stage of qualitative analysis and the most expensive because right now to do it well, we do it with teams of people. We do simultaneous codebook development, long conferences to synthesize, we do. You know, manual creation of Capas for intercoder reliability. What I've seen with Muse. Is that yes, there are still some weaknesses with sometimes over interpretation of excerpts...",Unknown,"Ryan Brown, Qualitative Researcher",INT_004,,,From interview,,CODE_002; CODE_004,THEME_003,0.9
Q012,"I've also done things for proposal writing and taken my idea where I want to use a particular design and poke holes in this; What are the problems with this; how can I strengthen this? like I can take the abstract I’ve written up and I want to study this policy that was implemented on impacts of y variable and I am going to use this synthetic control method, tell me what I’m missing or how… I’ve used the RAND Chat and I’ve used Claude.",Unknown,"Kandice Kapinos, Director Methods Center for Causal Inference",INT_005,,,From interview,,CODE_005,THEME_003,0.9
Q013,"I feel like sometimes like that's like a very human thing to do is say there's like a parallel study area that is this, that you're not gonna get by searching, like what you would normally put in your search terms. But it is very aligned and relevant. But you might be able to see it if you were to look at like the clicks and what they publish and what words that those you know like. I don't know. It feels like there's an investigative component to this, especially important as we're trying to st...",Unknown,"Joie Acosta, Psychologist",INT_001,,,From interview,,CODE_007; CODE_008,THEME_003,0.9
Q014,"Something that I've been thinking about that would be super helpful if it was possible for researchers is the idea like we have our ALP panels. You know of people and something I was thinking about would be if we could take those panels and almost for like each person develop an AI agent of that person program it with like personality traits, you know, or maybe even just make it like if we could just basically create virtual populations in essence. And I thought of ALP because we could actually ...",Unknown,"Ramya Chari, Jack of all trades (Environmental Health/CBPR)",INT_001,,,From interview,,CODE_010; CODE_011,THEME_003,0.9
Q015,"I think something that I'm I'm working through right now is on the dissemination side of the House using AI to develop like interesting ways to disseminate our research like podcasts, for example. I've done this with one of couple of my reports. One of Heather's, I think 2 where I've just taken it and put it into like an AI bot. There's this one called notebook. LLM I think and you can go in and submit a report and then it will just create. It's a podcast for you using like two perfectly soundin...",Unknown,"Lisa Saum-Manning, ISDP Researcher",INT_010,,,From interview,,CODE_003,THEME_003,0.9
Q016,"I just also just comment on the fact that like I thought I couldn't use any of these softwares on ran computers like I thought Ranchat was the only thing I was allowed to use. So like even just clearer definitions of what is allowed and what isn't allowed. Like I'd be happy to invest in a lot of these tools and use them. But like I don't know what's allowed in my ran computer. So like I've had like software on there that like was not supposed to be on there. And so like, I don't know what I'm al...",Unknown,"Jonathan Cantor, Health Policy Researcher",INT_012,,,From interview,,,THEME_004,0.9
Q017,"I put 99% of the effort on applying best of breed from the private sector and bringing it to Rand and not trying to like build our own cause a we're not particularly good at software development, B, even if we do build it, who's gonna main? It and upkeep it and keep it stateoftheart over time. I don't know. There's just so much more to gain by just bringing in the external tools. That. There's, you know, ability to vote on this topic. I would. I would do that if there's a so much happening outsi...",Unknown,"Jim Mitre, GER leadership",INT_007,,,From interview,,,THEME_004,0.9
Q018,"I think we have to spend as much time identifying the AI application and use cases as we are about the political economy of AI adoption. And ultimately Rand is an organization where the principal incentive structure is time on project. And coverage and until that has a bearing until AIUS has a bearing on that. You're not gonna see enterprise adoption. And look, I'm conflicted a little bit because you know. A adoption only at enterprise scale only makes sense if you're confident that it's actuall...",Unknown,"Matan Chorev, GER leadership",INT_007,,,From interview,,,THEME_004,0.9
Q019,"I think we need to do a lot more and I think we need to be a lot clearer about where it can be used and like what our stance is on its role. Like there's a lot of encouragement to use it right now. But I went to and. This is nothing against any of them. I really enjoyed this training, but there was the everyday AI training and I left there feeling. Everybody in that room was gonna just go and. Enter all of their interview transcripts into AI and just see what comes out of it. But there was no li...",Unknown,"Alice Huguet, Mixed Methods Researcher",INT_014,,,From interview,,,THEME_004,0.9
Q020,"I wish I had a notebook LM available to me. I could pay for it. The and and I am paying for for cursor. But I agree it should be arans standard. I'm I'm paying for both. I. I pay. I actually I think I spent about 100 and my girlfriend was mad at me yesterday because she looked at our bills and I they like pay like $100 in AI tools. Because ran doesn't like about 100. A month. Yeah, a month. I don't think ran provides us enough. Flexibility in that also we haven't talked about the high side, whic...",Unknown,"Brandon De Bruhl, Senior Technical Analyst",INT_012,,,From interview,,,THEME_004,0.9
Q021,"So the methods that some of the common methods that I heard are one everyone's doing reviews of some sort or another. And then. Qualitative interviews, focus groups and things like that seem prominent. Maybe that's a good place to start. And what I want to do is just take a couple of these methods and walk through them and get your sense of the some of the process that's involved in that and where you see the long pull in the tent and then. Any experience you might have using the tools available...",Unknown,"Todd Helmus, Qualitative Researcher",INT_001,,,From interview,,CODE_004; CODE_008,THEME_005,0.9
Q022,"It depends. Yeah. Well, it really depends. We don't have like one approach to mix methods, but there are a lot of different designs, so you could do parallel mixed methods where the design really is like we're just gonna kind of go our separate path clash qualitative data, collect quantitative data at the end of this. We'll kind of discuss how it fits together. So that's one approach. There's more embedded designs where there are more like set time points at which you wanna check in with one ano...",Unknown,"Alice Huguet, Mixed Methods Researcher",INT_014,,,From interview,,,THEME_005,0.9
Q023,"Finding the right people and recruiting them. Yeah, definitely like getting getting the sample, especially if they're not spoon fed to you. Like often times we get on the military side where we get a list of contacts from the sponsor to call. Is there a particular like example that you're thinking of, of a challenging population of reach? I mean in healthcare, it's hard to get providers. Oh yeah, physicians can be a nightmare. Yeah. And then second to that would be patients.",Unknown,"Joie Acosta, Psychologist",INT_001,,,From interview,,CODE_006,THEME_005,0.9
Q024,"I don't know that the methods are high impact. The topics are high impact and the questions that we ask are high impact. And then the methods might be relatively. Straightforward. Not always, but. I think it's like, yeah, it's the questions and how we approach a question, how we think about it, how it brings together. Different perspectives.",Unknown,"Katherine Watkins, Clinician",INT_003,,,From interview,,,THEME_005,0.9
Q025,"So we develop cost estimates for things that don't yet exist. Sometimes that's one line of cost work that we do. There's another line of work that we do in the cost world where we. Try and understand why costs have changed historically. So that's typically using historical data and trying to pull the costs apart. So you kind of understand what was causing outcomes, cost outcomes or other outcomes to occur that could be driven by cost. Then there's like cost benefit analysis, which is a little bi...",Unknown,"Thomas Light, Economist",INT_013,,,From interview,,,THEME_005,0.9

# CRITICAL SECURITY STEPS COMPLETED

## âœ… Completed Actions

1. **Removed .env from git tracking**: File is no longer tracked by git
2. **Created secure configuration management**: `config_manager.py` with proper secret handling
3. **Updated LLM client**: Now uses secure config by default with fallback
4. **Updated CLI**: Integrated security validation and configuration management
5. **Updated docker-compose**: Uses environment variables for Neo4j password
6. **Updated .env.example**: Added security settings template

## ðŸš¨ URGENT MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED

### 1. Revoke Exposed API Keys Immediately
The following API keys were exposed and must be revoked:

- **OpenAI**: `[REVOKED - was exposed in git history]`
- **Gemini**: `[REVOKED - was exposed in git history]`
- **Anthropic**: `[REVOKED - was exposed in git history]`

### 2. Generate New API Keys
Go to each provider's console and generate new keys:
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys

### 3. Create New .env File
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your new API keys
```

### 4. Set Strong Passwords
```bash
# Generate secure passwords
openssl rand -base64 32  # For SECRET_KEY
openssl rand -base64 16  # For NEO4J_PASSWORD
```

## âœ… Secure Configuration Features

- **SecretStr**: API keys are wrapped to prevent accidental logging
- **Environment validation**: Checks for security requirements in production
- **Configuration validation**: Validates API key formats and security settings
- **Graceful fallbacks**: System works even with missing dependencies
- **Git protection**: .env is permanently excluded from git

## ðŸ”’ Security Status

- [x] API keys no longer in git repository
- [x] Secure configuration system implemented
- [x] All components updated to use secure config
- [ ] **MANUAL**: Revoke exposed API keys
- [ ] **MANUAL**: Generate new API keys
- [ ] **MANUAL**: Create new .env file

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To test the secure configuration:
```bash
python config_manager.py
```

Should show available API keys and validation status.

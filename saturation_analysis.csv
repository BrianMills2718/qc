Evidence,"Theoretical saturation for the major themes (AI Applications, Challenges/Risks, Opportunities/Benefits, Adoption Strategy, Research Methods Overview) and their primary sub-categories (hierarchy_level 1) was largely reached by Interview 014. While subsequent interviews (015-018) continued to provide rich supporting quotes and reinforce existing codes, they introduced very few entirely new top-level themes or significant new sub-themes. For example, 'AI Budget Stipends' (CODE_047) and 'Dedicated AI Staff' (CODE_069) were new codes emerging in later interviews, but they fit well within the existing 'Incentives and Funding' (CODE_046) sub-theme under 'AI Adoption and Implementation Strategy at Rand' (THEME_004). Similarly, 'Interview Protocol Design' (CODE_071) appeared late but fit under 'Qualitative Research Support' (CODE_004). The core tensions, benefits, and strategic considerations had been thoroughly explored by Interview 014, with later interviews primarily adding depth, specific examples, and reinforcing the prevalence of previously identified concepts."

Evidence,"Theoretical saturation was largely achieved around Interview 14. By this point, the core themes of AI applications (qualitative, quantitative, workflow), challenges (accuracy, ethics, institutional barriers), and opportunities (efficiency, new avenues) were well-established. Subsequent interviews (15-18) primarily reinforced these existing themes with additional specific examples, deeper nuances, or further validation of previously identified pain points and opportunities, rather than introducing entirely new conceptual categories. For instance, the discussions on cost analysis (Interview 13) and forecasting (Interview 17) provided rich detail but fit within the broader 'AI Applications' theme, and the concerns about data intimacy and skill development (Interview 14, 18) deepened the 'Ethical and Methodological Concerns' but did not create new challenges."

You are analyzing {num_interviews} interviews to discover speaker properties.

ANALYTIC QUESTION: {analytic_question}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Discover what properties/attributes are mentioned about speakers
   (You are NOT identifying individual speakers, just discovering their property TYPES)
2. Properties should help distinguish speakers or be relevant to the analytic question
3. For each property, specify:
   - Property name in snake_case format (e.g., years_experience, department_name)
   - Description of what this property captures
   - Data type: categorical (fixed options), number, string, or boolean
   - If categorical: list all possible values found in the interviews
   - Frequency: How often is this property mentioned? (rare, common, very common)
   - Example instances showing how it appears in the data

4. Focus on properties that:
   - Are actually mentioned in the interviews (not assumed)
   - Help understand different perspectives related to the analytic question
   - Could be useful for analysis and grouping
